## My Task

Create a code quiz that tracks high scores using JavaScript, Web API's, HTML, and CSS.



## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

## My Project

‚ú® My website opens with a landing page featuring a title, brief description, and a "Start Quiz" button. When the button is clicked, a 90-second timer is triggered, giving the user 15 seconds per question.

‚ú® Next, I appended an HTML page containing 6 multiple choice questions, with 4 possible answers each. For each wrong answer, 10 seconds are subtracted from the timer. All answers are recorded with an event listener that keeps track of all correct answers clicked.

‚ú®When the timer runs out, the page shows the user's final score and number of questions answered correctly.

‚ú®There is an input box for the user's initials to save to a local storage list of high scores. When the submit button is clicked, all of the high scores and the corresponding intials saved on the local storage are displayed.

‚ú®The user has the option to start over or clear the high scores. Below is a gif recording of my final website, accessible at the following URL: üíªüñ± https://hrdowell.github.io/04-Code-Quiz/
